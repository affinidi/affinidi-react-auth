# Overview

**AUGMENT EXPERIENCES WITH A SAFER, SIMPLER AND MORE PRIVATE WAY TO LOGIN**

A paradigm shift in the registration and sign-in process, Affinidi Login is a game-changing solution for developers. With our revolutionary passwordless authentication solution your user's first sign-in doubles as their registration, and all the necessary data for onboarding can be requested during this streamlined sign-in/signup process. End users are in full control, ensuring that they consent to the information shared in a transparent and user-friendly manner. This streamlined approach empowers developers to create efficient user experiences with data integrity, enhanced security and privacy, and ensures compatibility with industry standards.

| Passwordless Authentication | Decentralised Identity Management | Uses Latest Standards |
|---|---|---|
| Offers a secure and user-friendly alternative to traditional password-based authentication by eliminating passwords and thus removing the vulnerability to password-related attacks such as phishing and credential stuffing. | Leverages OID4VP to enable users to control their data and digital identity, selectively share their credentials and authenticate themselves across multiple platforms and devices without relying on a centralised identity provider. | Utilises OID4VP to enhance security of the authentication process by verifying user authenticity without the need for direct communication with the provider, reducing risk of tampering and ensuring data integrity. |

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
